## Program generates a list of bytes offsets where sequence begins.
## Also generates byte offsets of the start of headers.
##
##
## Output is tab-delimited file of two columns.  First column is the
## byte offset, and the secon dcolumn is the sequence name.  If the
## sequence name begins with '>', then its the start of the FASTA
## header.
